# Jolliest-Site – https://jerryl556.github.io/Jolliest-Site/

A cozy Christmas scene with snowfall that piles up, a drag-and-drop Snow Bomb, and a pull-to-joy alarm that cranks the jolliness meter.

## Main features and how they work
- Snow that builds up: Canvas-rendered flakes fall with gravity, wind, and random sway, then settle into a heightmap so the snow visually piles higher over time. A soft blur and gradient shading on the accumulated layers sell the drift.
- Holiday controls: The “Holiday Hub” sliders tweak flake speed, density, gravity, wind, and spawn rate, letting you go from gentle flurries to full Blizzard Mode without reloading.
- Snow Bomb clean-up: The bomb is draggable; when released it detonates at the drop point, carving a circular blast out of the snow heightmap and spawning a matching blast animation so the cleared area instantly shows.
- Pull-to-joy alarm: A draggable hand illustration acts like a spring-loaded lever. Pulling it to the stop triggers a jolliness increment, plays the “ho ho ho” audio, flashes the alarm lamps, and now cues an elf parade on every 10th pull.
